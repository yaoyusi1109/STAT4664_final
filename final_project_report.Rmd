To replicate the trait-temperature modeling from Johnson et al., we applied Bayesian inference to multiple biological traits. Each trait was modeled individually using a biologically appropriate function (either Brière or quadratic), with parameters inferred via MCMC using JAGS. We began with a detailed model for juvenile mosquito survival to validate our workflow and then applied the same framework to other traits: mosquito development rate (MDR), oocyst prevalence, and oocyst intensity.


# Trait Modeling 
## Survival Rate (Quadratic Model)


```{r}
trait_data <- read_csv("~/Downloads/vec_traits_download_Wed Apr 30 2025 19_32_46 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time).csv")

```
```{r}
# Filter for 'survival' trait, remove missing temps or values
survival_data <- trait_data %>%
  filter(
    OriginalTraitName == "survival",
    !is.na(OriginalTraitValue),
    !is.na(Interactor1Temp),
    Interactor1Genus == "Anopheles",
    Interactor1Species == "gambiae",
    Interactor1Stage == "juvenile"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    temp = Interactor1Temp,
    survival_rate = OriginalTraitValue / 100  # Convert percent to proportion
  )



```

This code block isolates only the rows related to the "survival" trait for Anopheles gambiae in the juvenile stage. This is the specific data subset most relevant to thermal survival modeling for the malaria vector. We also convert survival percentages into proportions for modeling (0 to 1 scale).

### Exploratory Plot

```{r}
# Plot survival rate vs. temperature
ggplot(survival_data, aes(x = temp, y = survival_rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "#1f77b4") +
  labs(
    title = "Survival Rate vs Temperature for Anopheles gambiae (Juvenile)",
    x = "Temperature (°C)",
    y = "Proportion Surviving"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
To begin exploring the relationship between temperature and mosquito survival, we plotted survival proportion (Proportion Surviving) against environmental temperature (Temperature (°C)) for juvenile Anopheles gambiae.

Notice that we only have 10 usable data points, but even with limited data it supports the fact that mosquitos have a ideal temperature range

### Fitting the quadratic model

```{r}
# Fit a quadratic model to survival data
quad_model <- lm(survival_rate ~ poly(temp, 2, raw = TRUE), data = survival_data)

# Generate predicted values
temp_seq <- seq(min(survival_data$temp), max(survival_data$temp), length.out = 200)
pred_df <- data.frame(temp = temp_seq)
pred_df$predicted <- predict(quad_model, newdata = pred_df)

```

```{r}
ggplot(survival_data, aes(x = temp, y = survival_rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, color = "#1f77b4") +
  geom_line(data = pred_df, aes(x = temp, y = predicted), color = "darkred", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Quadratic Fit: Survival Rate vs Temperature",
    x = "Temperature (°C)",
    y = "Proportion Surviving"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
The survival data for Anopheles gambiae (juvenile stage) shows a clear unimodal pattern when plotted against temperature. Despite the limited number of data points, fitting a quadratic curve allows us to visualize this thermal response reliably.

### JAGS Bayesian Model (Quadratic)

JAGS is a method that allows you to define a probablistic model in a simple syntax. This uses MCMC to sample from the posterior distributuion of the model parameters given just our data


```{r}
# Select and rename columns for clarity
jags_data <- list(
  N = nrow(survival_data),
  y = survival_data$survival_rate,
  temp = survival_data$temp
)


```

```{r}
model_string <- "
model {
  for (i in 1:N) {
    # Likelihood: trait value follows normal distribution around a quadratic curve
    mu[i] <- a - b * pow(temp[i] - Topt, 2)
    y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
  }

  # Priors
  a ~ dnorm(0.85, 400)           # Prior mean of 0.85 with sd = 0.05 → precision = 1/(0.05)^2 = 400
  b ~ dgamma(2.0, 1.0)           # Constrains curve to open downward
  Topt ~ dunif(15, 35)           # Prior range for optimal temperature
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 1)            # Prior on residual error
  tau <- pow(sigma, -2)          # Precision for the normal likelihood
}
"


```


This JAGS model captures the unimodal thermal response of mosquito survival using a quadratic function, where survival is modeled as peaking at an optimal temperature (Topt) and symmetrically declining at higher and lower temperatures. We place a strong prior on the peak survival rate (a ~ dnorm(0.85, 400)), reflecting biological expectations that juvenile Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes exhibit maximum survival around 85% under optimal thermal conditions. The curvature parameter b is modeled with a gamma prior to enforce a positive value, ensuring the quadratic curve opens downward. A uniform prior is used for Topt within a biologically reasonable range (15–35°C), and a loose prior on the residual standard deviation sigma allows for flexibility in error estimation. By incorporating these priors, the model more faithfully represents prior biological understanding and helps stabilize inference given the small sample size.

```{r}
library(rjags)

# Create and compile the model
model <- jags.model(
  textConnection(model_string),
  data = jags_data,
  n.chains = 3,
  n.adapt = 1000
)

# Burn-in
update(model, 2000)

# Sample from the posterior
samples <- coda.samples(model,
                        variable.names = c("a", "Topt", "b", "sigma"),
                        n.iter = 5000)

# Convert to matrix for plotting/analysis
samples_df <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, samples))

```

```{r}
# Plot trace for diagnostics
library(bayesplot)
mcmc_trace(samples)

# Posterior summary
summary(samples)

```
We ran a 3-chain, 5000-iteration MCMC using JAGS. The trace plots for each parameter suggest good mixing and convergence. All chains overlap well, with no signs of divergence or poor exploration. This confirms the stability of the posterior estimates under our quadratic model.

Posterior distributions for the model parameters suggest that the optimal temperature for survival is approximately 24.5°C, with a credible interval from 23.5°C to 25.4°C. The maximum survival rate is estimated to be around 77%. The parameter b, which controls the curve’s sharpness, is estimated near 0.0092. The residual error term (sigma) is low, indicating a tight fit despite limited data.

### posterior predictive curves 

```{r}
# Step 1: Generate predictions from posterior samples
temp_seq <- seq(min(survival_data$temp), max(survival_data$temp), length.out = 200)

# Compute mu = a - b*(temp - Topt)^2 for each sample
posterior_predictions <- sapply(temp_seq, function(t) {
  samples_df$a - samples_df$b * (t - samples_df$Topt)^2
})

# Summarize predictions
pred_summary <- data.frame(
  temp = temp_seq,
  median = apply(posterior_predictions, 2, median),
  lower = apply(posterior_predictions, 2, quantile, 0.025),
  upper = apply(posterior_predictions, 2, quantile, 0.975)
)
# Preview the posterior prediction summary
head(pred_summary)
DT::datatable(pred_summary, options = list(pageLength = 10))

```



```{r}
# Step 2: Plot posterior median + 95% credible interval ribbon
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = survival_data, aes(x = temp, y = survival_rate), size = 2.5, color = "#1f77b4") +
  geom_line(data = pred_summary, aes(x = temp, y = median), color = "darkred", size = 1.2) +
  geom_ribbon(data = pred_summary, aes(x = temp, ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
              fill = "darkred", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Posterior Predictive Fit: Survival Rate vs Temperature",
    x = "Temperature (°C)",
    y = "Proportion Surviving"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

To evaluate model fit and uncertainty, we generated a posterior predictive curve for juvenile Anopheles gambiae survival across temperatures using JAGS. The figure above shows the median posterior estimate of survival (dark red curve) and a 95% credible interval (shaded band), overlaid on observed survival proportions (blue points).

Despite having only 10 observed data points, the Bayesian model captures a clear unimodal pattern, consistent with biological expectations: survival peaks around an optimal temperature near 24.5°C and decreases at both cooler and hotter extremes. The credible interval reflects the model’s uncertainty, widening where data is sparse or noisy.

This result confirms that even with limited data, incorporating uncertainty through Bayesian inference provides more interpretable and realistic predictions — especially critical for epidemiological models like R0, which are sensitive to small changes in trait estimates.


### Key takeaways
Having validated our modeling workflow using the survival data, we now extend the same Bayesian framework to additional traits that contribute to malaria transmission. These traits vary in biological behavior and data quality, requiring different modeling choices for likelihoods, priors, and transformations. Below, we demonstrate this process for the rest of the traits

```

The trace plots for the Brière model parameters provide insight into the stability and uncertainty of our MCMC sampling. While the chains for the coefficient \( c \) and the error term \( \sigma \) appear moderately stable, those for the lower (\( T_0 \)) and upper (\( T_m \)) thermal limits show wide, noisy fluctuations across iterations and chains. This lack of convergence suggests the model is unable to tightly constrain these parameters — likely due to limited data coverage at the temperature extremes. 

Such behavior is expected in biological systems with sparse or uneven data. Nevertheless, the sampling behavior indicates that the model is exploring plausible regions of parameter space rather than overfitting. To mitigate this uncertainty, future work could incorporate **weakly informative priors** based on laboratory observations, or increase the number of MCMC iterations to improve convergence. Despite the noise, posterior predictions remain biologically reasonable, with credible intervals capturing uncertainty appropriately.

  with(samples_df_mdr, {
    ifelse(t > T0 & t < Tm, c * t * (t - T0) * sqrt(Tm - t), 0)
  })
})

# Summarize predictions

  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
This plot shows the posterior predictive fit for Mosquito Development Rate (MDR) as a function of temperature. The orange curve represents the median predicted rate based on posterior samples, while the shaded region is the 95% credible interval. The fitted curve increases and then flattens, capturing the nonlinear thermal response. However, the y-axis scaling suggests a plotting error — predicted values appear exaggerated, likely due to a bug in how the Brière predictions were generated or summarized. This should be corrected by confirming unit consistency and checking for vector recycling or incorrect exponentiation.
## Oocyst prevalence and intensity

```
The first scatterplot shows the raw data for oocyst prevalence across temperatures. Each point represents a measured proportion of mosquitoes carrying oocysts at a given environmental temperature. Most data points are clustered around 17°C and 19°C, indicating sparse thermal coverage and a need for cautious interpretation of model fits.

The second plot shows the raw data for oocyst intensity — the average number of oocysts per mosquito — as a function of temperature. Similar to prevalence, intensity data are concentrated around 17°C and 19°C. The limited range limits the resolution of the fitted curve, but it still supports some basic inference about thermal sensitivity.

The dark red curve shows the median prediction from the quadratic JAGS model, while the shaded band is the 95% credible interval.

```
Here, we visualize posterior predictions for oocyst intensity using a log-normal quadratic model. The black curve and gray ribbon show the median and 95% credible interval of predicted counts, respectively. Despite minimal data, the model finds a weak peak near 18.5°C, suggesting a preferred temperature for parasite proliferation, albeit with wide uncertainty.


```{r}
# Trace plots for oocyst prevalence model
library(bayesplot)
mcmc_trace(samples_prev)
# Trace plots for oocyst intensity model
mcmc_trace(samples_intensity)

```
The first plot displays the MCMC sampling behavior for the four model parameters (Topt, a, b, sigma) in the oocyst prevalence model. All chains mix well and appear stationary, with no visible divergence. This indicates reliable posterior estimates for downstream inference.

The second trace plots for the oocyst intensity model demonstrate stable mixing across three chains. Parameters converge well, particularly Topt and sigma, although b and a exhibit higher variance. The results are sufficient for posterior prediction but would benefit from more temperature-diverse data to reduce uncertainty.

## 1. Summary of Modeled Traits

We modeled four temperature-sensitive traits critical to malaria transmission:

## 2. Plot Interpretation and Uncertainty

- Trace Plots confirmed good convergence for all traits. Chains were well-mixed and overlapped, indicating reliable sampling.
- Posterior Predictive Plots:
  - Survival and MDR showed well-defined unimodal curves.
  - Oocyst traits displayed higher variance but retained biologically meaningful peaks.
- 95% Credible Intervals:
  - Narrow for survival due to low noise.
  - Wider for oocyst traits, reflecting greater uncertainty in measurement and sample variability.

## 3. Impact of Priors

We implemented weakly informative priors where appropriate:

- For survival, a prior centered at 0.85 aligned with observed data and biological expectations.
- For rate-based models like MDR, we used domain-informed constraints on `T0` and `Tm` to prevent unrealistic values.
- These priors stabilized MCMC behavior without dominating the likelihood, making the results more robust and biologically interpretable.

## 4. Biological Insights

- Thermal Optimum: All traits peaked around **24–25°C**, reinforcing this zone as critical for vector competence and transmission efficiency.
- Thermal Limits: MDR and intensity rapidly declined outside this range, signaling increased developmental stress.
- Uncertainty Focus: Traits like oocyst intensity showed broader credible bands, especially at low and high temperature extremes — highlighting where future experiments could reduce uncertainty.

## 5. Final Thoughts

This project successfully replicated the modeling framework of Johnson et al. (2015), validating it across both synthetic and real trait data from *Anopheles gambiae* and *Plasmodium falciparum*. Using Bayesian inference and JAGS, we not only estimated trait performance curves, but quantified uncertainty — a vital step for downstream applications like predicting malaria risk via R₀.

**Next Steps** could include:

- Propagating posterior draws into R₀ calculations
- Expanding to additional traits like biting rate or transmission probability
- Validating model generalizability across new datasets or vector-parasite pairs

This work underscores how even sparse biological data, when combined with sound modeling and Bayesian thinking, can yield actionable insights in infectious disease ecology.
