# Conclusions

## 1. Summary of Modeled Traits

We modeled four temperature-sensitive traits critical to malaria transmission:

| Trait | Model Used | Data Quality | Optimal Temperature (Topt) | Peak Value Estimate | Notes |
|------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Survival Rate** | Quadratic | 10 pts | \~24.5°C | \~0.77 proportion | Juvenile stage; reliable fit |
| **MDR** | Brière | 10 pts | \~8.9–13°C (T0), \~38°C (Tm) | c ≈ 5.6e-5 | Inverted development time |
| **Oocyst Prevalence** | Quadratic | Moderate | \~24.5°C | \~0.75–0.85 | Proportional data |
| **Oocyst Intensity** | Quadratic (log-scale) | Moderate | \~24°C–25°C | Count scale \~1–15 | Log-normal model fit |


## 2. Plot Interpretation and Uncertainty

-   Trace Plots confirmed good convergence for all traits. Chains were well-mixed and overlapped, indicating reliable sampling.
-   Posterior Predictive Plots:
    -   Survival and MDR showed well-defined unimodal curves.
    -   Oocyst traits displayed higher variance but retained biologically meaningful peaks.
-   95% Credible Intervals:
    -   Narrow for survival due to low noise.
    -   Wider for oocyst traits, reflecting greater uncertainty in measurement and sample variability.

## 3. Impact of Priors

We implemented weakly informative priors where appropriate:

-   For survival, a prior centered at 0.85 aligned with observed data and biological expectations.
-   For rate-based models like MDR, we used domain-informed constraints on `T0` and `Tm` to prevent unrealistic values.
-   These priors stabilized MCMC behavior without dominating the likelihood, making the results more robust and biologically interpretable.

## 4. Biological Insights

-   Thermal Optimum: All traits peaked around **24–25°C**, reinforcing this zone as critical for vector competence and transmission efficiency.
-   Thermal Limits: MDR and intensity rapidly declined outside this range, signaling increased developmental stress.
-   Uncertainty Focus: Traits like oocyst intensity showed broader credible bands, especially at low and high temperature extremes — highlighting where future experiments could reduce uncertainty.

## 5. Final Thoughts

This project successfully replicated the modeling framework of Johnson et al. (2015), validating it across both synthetic and real trait data from *Anopheles gambiae* and *Plasmodium falciparum*. Using Bayesian inference and JAGS, we not only estimated trait performance curves, but quantified uncertainty — a vital step for downstream applications like predicting malaria risk via R₀.

**Next Steps** could include:

-   Propagating posterior draws into R₀ calculations
-   Expanding to additional traits like biting rate or transmission probability
-   Validating model generalizability across new datasets or vector-parasite pairs

This work underscores how even sparse biological data, when combined with sound modeling and Bayesian thinking, can yield actionable insights in infectious disease ecology.
