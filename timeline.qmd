## Problems 

I found it hard to follow the dataset collected.Not exactly sure what does original trait column mean. 

## Timeline

As for this project, we plan to do it live.

**Week 1**: April 9–April 15, 2025

-   Goal: Setup and Data Acquisition
    -   Yusi: Confirm data availability: Email Prof. Johnson or check VectorByte/supplementary materials for biting rate data. If unavailable, design synthetic data (e.g., 20–30 data points with a unimodal trend, noise from a truncated normal, based on Fig. 1 in the paper).

    -   Rahul: Draft the Brière function $a(T) = c\,T\,(T - T_0)\,(T_m - T)^{1/2}$ in code (e.g., Python or R) and test it with dummy parameters. - Define uniform priors: $T_0 \in [0, 20], \quad T_m \in [30, 50], \quad c \in [0, 0.1]$ (adjust c range based on literature if needed).
-   Together: Meet to finalize data and share initial code.

**Week 2: April 16–April 22, 2025**

**Goal:** Likelihood and MCMC Skeleton

-   **Yusi:**
    -   Code the truncated normal likelihood for biting rate observations (non-negative, mean from Brière function).
    -   Prepare a small test dataset (real or synthetic) for initial runs.
-   **Rahul:**
    -   Build the Metropolis-Hastings skeleton:
        -   Proposal generation (e.g., normal jumps for each parameter)
        -   Acceptance ratio and sampling loop
    -   Test with a simple run (e.g., 1,000 iterations) using dummy data.
-   **Together:**
    -   Debug the combined likelihood and MCMC code.

**Week 3: April 23–April 29, 2025**

**Goal:** Initial MCMC Run and Tuning

-   **Yusi:**
    -   Run the MCMC with 10,000 iterations on the test dataset.
    -   Generate trace plots for ( c ), ( T_0 ), and ( T_m ) to check convergence.
-   **Rahul:**
    -   Calculate acceptance rates and adjust proposal step sizes (aim for 20–40% acceptance).
    -   Add basic posterior summary statistics (mean, 95% credible intervals).
-   **Together:**
    -   Review diagnostics and tweak step sizes if mixing is poor.
