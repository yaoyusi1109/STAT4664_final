    "text": "4.2 Timeline\nAs for this project, we plan to do it live.\nWeek 1: April 9–April 15, 2025\n\nGoal: Setup and Data Acquisition\n\nYusi: Confirm data availability: Email Prof. Johnson or check VectorByte/supplementary materials for biting rate data. If unavailable, design synthetic data (e.g., 20–30 data points with a unimodal trend, noise from a truncated normal, based on Fig. 1 in the paper).\nRahul: Draft the Brière function \\(a(T) = c\\,T\\,(T - T_0)\\,(T_m - T)^{1/2}\\) in code (e.g., Python or R) and test it with dummy parameters. - Define uniform priors: \\(T_0 \\in [0, 20], \\quad T_m \\in [30, 50], \\quad c \\in [0, 0.1]\\) (adjust c range based on literature if needed).\n\nTogether: Meet to finalize data and share initial code.\n\nWeek 2: April 16–April 22, 2025\nGoal: Likelihood and MCMC Skeleton\n\nYusi:\n\nCode the truncated normal likelihood for biting rate observations (non-negative, mean from Brière function).\nPrepare a small test dataset (real or synthetic) for initial runs.\n\nRahul:\n\nBuild the Metropolis-Hastings skeleton:\n\nProposal generation (e.g., normal jumps for each parameter)\nAcceptance ratio and sampling loop\n\nTest with a simple run (e.g., 1,000 iterations) using dummy data.\n\nTogether:\n\nDebug the combined likelihood and MCMC code.\n\n\nWeek 3: April 23–April 29, 2025\nGoal: Initial MCMC Run and Tuning\n\nYusi:\n\nRun the MCMC with 10,000 iterations on the test dataset.\nGenerate trace plots for ( c ), ( T_0 ), and ( T_m ) to check convergence.\n\nRahul:\n\nCalculate acceptance rates and adjust proposal step sizes (aim for 20–40% acceptance).\nAdd basic posterior summary statistics (mean, 95% credible intervals).\n\nTogether:\n\nReview diagnostics and tweak step sizes if mixing is poor.",

    "text": "3 Key Objectives\nThe authors address several critical questions:\n\nTemperature Thresholds: Which temperatures prevent or promote malaria transmission?\nUncertainty Quantification: How uncertain are ( R_0 ) estimates across different temperatures?\nTrait Contributions: Which mosquito and parasite traits contribute most to this uncertainty, and at what temperature ranges?\n\nThe study uses malaria as a case study, but its methods are broadly applicable to other vector-borne diseases.\n\n\n4 Main Findings\nThe paper decomposes ( R_0 ) into temperature-dependent components—like mosquito biting rate, fecundity, mortality, and parasite development rate—and uses a Bayesian approach to model their thermal responses. Key findings include:\n\nBiting Rate (a): Dominates uncertainty from 15°C to 25°C, critical at lower transmission thresholds.\nFecundity (\\(\\text{EFD}\\)): Influences uncertainty across all temperatures, especially 25°C to 32°C.\nMosquito Mortality (\\(\\mu\\)): Drives uncertainty from 20°C to 30°C, key in the transmission peak.\nParasite Development Rate (\\(\\text{PDR}\\)): Significant at temperature extremes (15–16°C and 33–35°C).\n\nThese results suggest that targeting empirical research on these traits at their respective temperature ranges would most efficiently refine ( R_0 ) estimates, enhancing predictions of malaria dynamics under climate variability.\n\n\n5 Methodology Highlights\nThe authors employ a Bayesian framework to tackle data sparsity and quantify uncertainty:\n\nModel: They use the Ross-Macdonald model for malaria, where: \\[R_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{N r} \\times \\frac{a^2 \\, bc \\, \\exp(-\\mu / \\text{PDR})}{\\mu}}\\] Here, ( M = ) represents mosquito density, with components like ( a ) (biting rate), ( ) (mortality), and ( ) (parasite development rate) varying with temperature.\nThermal Responses: Traits are modeled with unimodal functions:\n\nBrière (asymmetric) for traits like biting rate.\nQuadratic (symmetric) for traits like mortality.\n\nBayesian Approach: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to sample posterior distributions of parameters, combining sparse lab data with priors to estimate uncertainty.",
